# ThatAppIWantedToMake
I still remember when I was in CS 1, we used jGRASP to program Java, but we didn't really need all those IDE features like debugger or project structures.

I want to make a programming environment that only has what's necessary for a course like CS 1.

The app enables me to chuck in Java code ...

and execute it, after hitting "run."

Can save the code you currently have in the editor and load it later ...

In this state, after hitting "load"

Dialog pops up

where selecting a Java file will populate the main editor with the code inside the file.

That's about it.
